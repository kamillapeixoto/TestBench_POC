 * @section [global]
 * Violates MISRA 2012 Required Rule 1.3, Taking address of near auto variable.
 * The code is not dynamically linked. An absolute stack address is obtained
 * when taking the address of the near auto variable. A source of error in
 * writing dynamic code is that the stack segment may be different from the data
 * segment.
 *
 * @section [global]
 * Violates MISRA 2012 Required Rule 5.1, Identifier clash
 * The supported compilers use more than 31 significant characters for identifiers.

 * Functions are APIs, so they shall not be made static.
 *
 * @section [global]
 * Violates MISRA 2012 Required Rule 8.4, external symbol defined without a prior

 * The symbols are declared in the driver common file as external; they are needed

 * a part of the public API.
 *
 * @section [global]
 * Violates MISRA 2012 Required Rule 11.1, Conversion between a pointer
 * to function and another type.
 * The cast is required to define a callback function.
